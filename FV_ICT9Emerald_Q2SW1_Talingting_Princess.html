			<h3>POMERANIAN</h3>
		</td>
		<td>
			<div class="#FFC0CB-background">
			<h4>The magnificent coat, grinning, foxy face, and vivacious personality has contributed to the Pomeranian breed becoming one of the world's most popular toy breeds. The Pomeranian has a small body, which is less than seven pounds, and a commanding big-dog demeanor. The plentiful double coat, with its frill extending over the chest and shoulders, is available in nearly two dozen colors, as well as a variety of patterns and distinguishing features, but is most commonly seen in orange or red. Pomeranians are alert and intelligent, making them excellent watchdogs and lively pets for families with children old enough to tell the difference between a toy dog and a toy. Pomeranians are active, but they can be exercised with indoor play and short walks, so they can live in the city or the suburbs.</h4>

			<h3>CHOW CHOW</h3>
		</td>
		<td>
			<div class="#F0E68C-background">
			<h4>The Chow Chow, an all-purpose dog from ancient China, resembles a muscular, deep-chested aristocrat with an air of incomprehensible timelessness. The Chow Chow is a breed of one-of-a-kind delights, dignified, serious-minded, and aloof. Chows are large, powerful dogs that can stand up to 20 inches at the shoulder. A lion's mane ruff around the head and shoulders; a blue-black tongue; deep-set almond eyes that add to a scowling, snobbish expression; and a stiff-legged gait are among their distinguishing features. Chows can have red, black, blue, cinnamon, or cream coats that are rough or smooth. Chows, according to their owners, are the cleanest of dogs: they housebreak easily, have little doggy odor, and are as fastidious as cats. Chows who have been socialized are never aggressive or difficult to handle.</h4>

			<h3>AUSTRALIAN SHEPERD</h3>
		</td>
		<td>
			<div class="#ADD8E6-background">
			<h4>A lean, tough ranch dog is one of those "only in America" stories: a European breed perfected in California via Australia. They are fixtures on the rodeo circuit and are closely associated with the cowboy lifestyle. The cowboy's herding dog of choice is the Australian Shepherd, a medium-sized worker with a keen, penetrating gaze in the eye. Australian coats come in a variety of styles, including merle (a mottled pattern with contrasting shades of blue or red). In every way, they exemplify tough and agile stock movers. Aussies have an insatiable desire to herd anything: birds, dogs, and children. Because of their strong work drive, Aussies may be too much for a sedentary pet owner. Aussies are remarkably intelligent, and they are quite capable of duping an unsuspecting new owner. Simply put, the Australian Shepherd is not a pet for everyone.</h4>
